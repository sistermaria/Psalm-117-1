<p>Psalm 117</p>
<article>Praise the Lord, ye children: praise ye the name of the Lord.</article>

<article>Blessed be the name of the Lord, from henceforth now and for ever.</article>

<article> From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same, the name of the Lord is worthy of praise.</article>

 <article>The Lord is high above all nations; and his glory above the heavens.</article>

<article> Who is as the Lord our God, who dwelleth on high:</article>

<article> and looketh down on the low things in heaven and in earth?</article>

<article> Raising up the needy from the earth, and lifting up the poor out of the dunghill</article>

 <article>That he may place him with princes, with the princes of his people.</article>

<article> Who maketh a barren woman to dwell in a house, the joyful mother of children.</article>
